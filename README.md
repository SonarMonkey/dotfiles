# dotfiles
Various .files for my linux setup.
Most of these files use the Arc-Darker color scheme
The Cyberpunk scheme needs work, but probably won't get it, but it's there.

Note: These files were originally created for an old laptop running i3 on manjaro
I've since started using them in windows, on the Debian image for WSL
For more notes on that setup, see my debian-on-windows jank explanation.
Because of this, there may be incompatibilities and unresolved dependencies that will break things.
